Establishing Norms / Group contract / Code of Conduct


What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?
Vote

What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.
Be upfront
Acknowledge your assumption. ‘This is what I think is happening. This is what I think you think is happening.’

When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?
Slack the other group first so you don’t break their zone
When they’re ready they can help you
If you’re not able to figure it out together within 15 minutes, call a fellow

How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?
Based on preference
Leave pair norms to that pair
Have personal time to understand concepts

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?
Keep weekends sacred
Okay after hours if we haven’t met our goals
One day per weekend okay for simple things
